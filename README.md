A simple python guessing game
The game goes like this:

1. The computer will think of 3 digit number that has no repeating digits.
2. You will then guess a 3 digit number
3. The computer will then give back clues, the possible clues are:

    <p>Close: You've guessed a correct number but in the wrong position</p>
    <p>Match: You've guessed a correct number in the correct position</p>
    <p>Nope: You haven't guess any of the numbers correctly</p>

4. Based on these clues you will guess again until you break the code with a perfect match!
